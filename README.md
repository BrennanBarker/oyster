# Oyster
### Oyster is a Python package for conducting causal inference using causal diagrams.

Unsure what "causal inference" is or what's so awesome about causal diagrams? Check out the [walkthrough](walkthrough/1_intro_and_Causal_Diagrams.ipynb) for an overview of causal inference and an explanation of Oyster's features.  

## Installation
1) Clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/BrennanBarker/oyster.git


2) (Optional) Create a virtual environment to keep Oyster and its dependencies separate from your other packages
I recommend [pyenv+virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) but any environment manager (conda, etc.) will work.

3) Install the package manually using `pip`.  
This project is not currently listed on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org)

    pip install -e oyster


4) (Optional) Install Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to view the walkthrough interactively
Oyster doesn't need these packages to run on its own so for the sake of cleanliness they're not included as requirements.

    pip install jupyterlab
  
  *OR*
    
    pip install notebook
